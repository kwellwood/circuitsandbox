MUST-DO PRIORITY
-----------------

HIGH PRIORITY
--------------
o create sticky notes
o modify custom component format so they can be loaded as models? (maintain visual location data)

MEDIUM PRIORITY
----------------
o replace all point parameters with x, y (only return Points, never pass them)
o make connection points store wires instead of wire ids
o make lc.getwires return a collection of wires
o use iterators in sandbox for checking if a wire has been clicked
o get rid of the addwire(id, wire) and addcomponent(id, component) methods if they're unnecessary
o make componentimage.setstate abstract or part of an interface
o change undo/redo descriptions to include the commands they will execute

LOW PRIORITY
-------------
o convert white in a pasted custom component image to transparent
o when multiple components are selected with a drag, bring them all to front
o get toybox to display correct icons even when disabled
o fix wire nodes displaying on top of components
o make sandbox autoscroll when dragging a selection
o allow wire colors to be changed by selecting some and using a pulldown menu
o store wire colors in the model file

DOCUMENTATION
--------------
o check all comments
o put the model xml doctype in the model class comment, same with custom component
o put instructions for adding new primitive component somewhere
